# message_thread_retriever
Retrieves messages threads and processes them with ChatGPT

This was starter code for my recent backend development project for a stealth mode AI startup.  It includes Java code to retrieve message threads from Discord, Reddit and Slack.  Message threads are stored in a Postgres database.  As well, message threads are processed and analyzed using Azure OpenAI.

You can see my first attempts at prompt engineering in the file AzureOpenAI.java.

I have omitted details such as API credentials and specific message platform channel details.  Please consult API documentation for each platform to understand how to fill these in.
